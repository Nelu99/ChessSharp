# ChessSharp

Built using Unity and C#,  Chess# is a cross-platform 8-bit reinterpretation of the classic game of chess.
It adds upgrades to every piece after it succeeds in capturing an enemy.

Upgrades:
-The Pawn can now move backwards;
-The Rook plants bombs, blocking a position after every move;
-The horse can now move anywhere as long as the destination is at a distance of 2 blocks;
-The bishop can move right or left to change the color it stands on;
-The queen can change places with allied pieces:
-The king gains an extra move every time it captures;
